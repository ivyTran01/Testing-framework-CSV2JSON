CSV file specifications:
- Header:
    + The first row, containing column names.
    + This row is optional.
- Delimiter:
    + comma [,] is the most common delimiter.
    + semicolons [;] or tabs [\t] can also be used (especially when the values contain decimals)
    + only one designated delimiter allowed in one CSV file.
- Line endings:
    + Each row in terminated with a new line character.
    + The last row of the file may or may not end with a line break character.
- Row:
    + Each row contains data of one record.
    + Each row should contain the same number of field.
    + Values of this record is separated with the designated delimiter.
    + Each value in the row matches with the corresponding column name (specified in the header row).
    + Each value in the row matches with its position in the row if there are no column names.
- Quoting:
    + Use double quotes ["] on values that contain special characters such as the delimiter itself.
- Escape characters:
    + If a quoted value needs to have double quotes within it, then these inner quotes can be escaped by doubling them.
    + Single-quotes is equivalent to double-quotes for escaping.
- Leading/trailing whitespace:
    + Whitespaces are part of the data and shall not be trimmed automatically.
    + If whitespace at the beginning and end of a textual field value is significant, the text string should be text-qualified, i.e. enclosed in quotes.
- Empty cells:
    + Represented by an empty string "", or as null.
    + Each row should contain the same number of field.
